# Spark Project

## Overview

The aim of this project is to tackle the challenge of real-time analysis of data streams and enhance our practical skills in handling and analyzing streaming data. Our focus is on integrating Apache Spark Streaming, a fault-tolerant stream processing framework, with TextBlob, a Python-based natural language processing toolkit, to perform sentiment analysis on a data stream in real-time.
